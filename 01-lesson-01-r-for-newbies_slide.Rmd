## Learning Objectives 

- Discover what R is
- Understand the advantages of R
- Find your way around RStudio
- Get to know the basic R building blocks
- Get your hands dirty in R

## What is R?

- R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics
- It works with a wide variety of platforms

## Why R?

1. You can do **anything** in R.
2. R facilitates reproducible science
3. Long term gain from upfront investment

## RStudio - Making R a Breeze

- RStudio helps you write in R by:
    + sending your written code to R
    + 'syntax-highlighting'
    + keeping a history of your actions
    + giving you tools to fix your code when it doesn't work (debugging)
    
## RStudio - A visual walkthrough

- Livecoding session
- There's a handy cheat sheet for R studio available: (https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf). 
- Exercise: Set your working directory to your new project folder

## R building blocks

- The 3 main building block of R are:
    + names
    + data
    + functions

## Names

- We use the `<- ` assignment operator to assign a name. 
- Live coding demonstration

## Data

- Vectors
- Dataframes

## Functions

- functions are litte machines that perform specific tasks.

## Get your hands dirty

```{r}
ddata <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
```

Tricky to type? First, grab the link from Slack.

- then click on the 'Environment' tab, and find and click the 'Import Dataset button'. Then select the 'From Web URL...' option
- or save the file to you machine, follow the same steps, but select the 'From Local File...' option

Then change the 'name' you are giving to these data to `ddata` (see top left box).

To see the first few rows, type `head`

```
head(ddata)
```

We have data for 142 countries from 5 continents over 60 years.

```
      country year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
1 Afghanistan 1952  8425333      Asia   28.80     779.4
2 Afghanistan 1957  9240934      Asia   30.33     820.9
3 Afghanistan 1962 10267083      Asia   32.00     853.1
4 Afghanistan 1967 11537966      Asia   34.02     836.2
5 Afghanistan 1972 13079460      Asia   36.09     740.0
6 Afghanistan 1977 14880372      Asia   38.44     786.1
```


Load a plotting library called `ggplot2` (The `gg` refers to a famous book by William Cleveland called the 'Grammar of Graphics').

```
library(ggplot2)
```

We will use the `ggplot()` function from the ggplot2 library for plotting. This function needs to be told what data to use, which variable to put on the x-axis, and which on the y-axis. Things like the x-postion, the y-postion, the size and the colour of points are called `aesthetics` in the grammar of graphics.

Let's plot life expectancy against wealth (GDP).

```
ggplot(data=ddata, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp))
```

Notice how we are passing the data and the aesthetics as `arguments` to the function. But so far, this just makes an 'empty' plot. 

Next you tell ggplot what sort of plot (called a 'geometry') you want.

```
ggplot(data=ddata, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) + geom_point()
```

Want to see how this varies by continent? Try 'facetting' which means drawing mini-plots for each group.

```
ggplot(data=ddata, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~continent)
```

What about how things change over time? Add a new aesthetic (colour) for the `year` variable.

```
ggplot(data=ddata, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, colour=year)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~continent)
```

Would you like to make the plots easier to read by hiding the outliers?

```
ggplot(data=ddata, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, colour=year)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~continent) + coord_cartesian(x=c(0,50000))
```


And drop Oceania (there's not much data). We'll use another library called 'dplyr' that allows us to 'filter' the data easily.

> **TIP:** the `!=` operator means 'not equal to' so the statement below could be read as assign the name `data.4c` to the data made by filtering out all rows where the continent is _not equal_ to 'Oceania'.

```
library(dplyr)
data.4c <- filter(ddata, continent!="Oceania") 
```

Now plot with the _updated_ data.

```
ggplot(data=data.4c, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, colour=year)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~continent) + coord_cartesian(x=c(0,50000))
```

Cause for optimism? Or just home time? You have finished. See you next week.


OK? No! Nothing happened. Aren't functions supposed to do something? In this case, ggplot prepares the data for the graph. Now you need to `tell` ggplot what sort of graph you want.

Let's make a scatter plot.

## Exercises

## Questions

1. Can you explain the difference between the console and the source panes in R studio?
2. In RStudio, have a look in the _Environment_ tab of the pane on the top right? What do you think is shown here?
3. Try using the help function to find out what `ls()` does. Hint: try typing this in the search box of the _Help_ pane. Don't worry if the 'help' doesn't make much sense! Or just type `?ls` in the console.

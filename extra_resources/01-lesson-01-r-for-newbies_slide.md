## Learning Objectives 

- Discover what R is
- Understand the advantages of R
- Find your way around RStudio
- Get to know the basic R building blocks
- Get your hands dirty in R

## What is R?

- R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics
- It works with a wide variety of platforms

## Why R?

1. You can do **anything** in R.
2. R facilitates reproducible science
3. Long term gain from upfront investment

## RStudio - Making R a Breeze

- RStudio helps you write in R by:
    + sending your written code to R
    + 'syntax-highlighting'
    + keeping a history of your actions
    + giving you tools to fix your code when it doesn't work (debugging)
    
## RStudio - A visual walkthrough

- Livecoding session
- There's a handy cheat sheet for R studio available: (https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf). 
- Exercise: Set your working directory to your new project folder

## R building blocks

- Learn to navigate your folders via the command line
- The 3 main building block of R are:
    + names
    + data
    + functions
    
## Navigating folders

- Directories (folders) contain files and other directories
- Files have a 'name', and an 'extension': example.ext
- The 'root' directory is your starting point
    + `C:\` on windows
    + `/` on mac
- Livecoding example

## Names

- We use the `<- ` assignment operator to assign a name. 
- Live coding demonstration

## Data

- Vectors
- Dataframes

## Functions

- functions are litte machines that perform specific tasks.

## Exercises

- Start a new project in RStudio
- Create a new R script file
- Try adding some new values to your environment

## Questions

1. Can you explain the difference between the console and the source panes in R studio?
2. In RStudio, have a look in the _Environment_ tab of the pane on the top right? What do you think is shown here?
3. Try using the help function to find out what `ls()` does. Hint: try typing this in the search box of the _Help_ pane. Don't worry if the 'help' doesn't make much sense! Or just type `?ls` in the console.

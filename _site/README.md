This repository has been created mainly to use the wiki functionality.

There aren't meant to be any files in the repo itself for now so just click [here](https://github.com/datascibc/datasci4docs/wiki) or in the _wiki_ link in the link list above.

The logical next step will to convert this repository into the course website (via Jekyll), and probably duplicate some of the wiki pages there.

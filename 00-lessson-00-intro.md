## Lesson 

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants need to bring their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow. In exchange, you will leave with a working version of R, and the skills to use it.

*These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but working
through this lesson requires working copies of the software described below.
To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to install everything
*before* working through this lesson.
